        <p>
            Summer 2023 I was a as a Data Engineer Intern at Integral Ad Science (IAS) in New York City.
            I gained valauble experience working at a data driven public company. I was exposed to industy leading tools, software, 
            and team management. I worked on the partner measured data pipelines prefonining data quality analysis and pipiline modifications. My work was specifically focused on 
            optimizing data processing in aws kinesis and the storage. I really enjoyed leveraging my work ethic and problem solving skills to make signifigant contributions to the company.  
            I am looking forward to more oppurtunities in the future to continue growing as an engineer and applying my problem solving skills.

            At Bowdoin I am a member of the Mens Golf team. My strong work ethic has seen me grow from not playing in any competitions my freshman year to finishing tied 5th at one of our events last fall. 
            I also represent the team on the Bowdoin Student Athlete Advisory Committee. My experince playing a sport in college has taught me the importance of hardwork and dedication  
            and pride myself on always getting 1% better each and every day.
